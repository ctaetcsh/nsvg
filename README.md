# 2048 (for vibeOS)
Fork of [cojmar/nsvg](https://github.com/cojmar/nsvg) for porting into vibeOS as the the vibeOS SVG editor. This package uses Webview in vibeOS as it is a web application, but is run locally in vibeOS.

## Modified
Certain files have been removed/modified so that they can be tailored to vibeOS.
